# japanese-translation

Remembering kanji (japanese writing) is hard but sometimes pronounciation can be too.

Luckily remembering kanji can be tackled using RtK and by building stories about the parts making up the kanji! Ki does this but for pronounciation.

This works by decomposing the sounds of the original japanese word into english words.

Now you can easily build stories and mnemonics with these new words!
